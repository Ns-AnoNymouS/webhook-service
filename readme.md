# üöÄ FastAPI Webhook Subscription Service

This FastAPI project enables users to create, read, update, and delete webhook subscriptions. When events are triggered, the system sends POST requests (webhooks) to subscribed external URLs. It supports event type filtering, signature verification, and robust retry strategies to ensure delivery reliability.

## üìÜ Features

* ‚úÖ Create, Read, Update, Delete webhook subscriptions
* üì© Trigger webhooks for specific event types
* üåê Subscribe to all events with empty `event_types`

## üåü Architecture Overview

* **FastAPI** for serving HTTP API endpoints
* **MongoDB** (NoSQL) to store:

  * Subscription documents
  * Webhook delivery logs
* **Redis** for shared state and coordination
* **AsyncIO Queue** to handle high-throughput delivery
* **HTTPX** for async HTTP requests
* **Retry logic** using static intervals

---

## üîß Why NoSQL (MongoDB)?

* Subscription documents can vary and grow in schema over time.
* Delivery logs may be numerous and not require strong relational consistency.
* Indexes can be applied on `subscription_id`, `event_type`, and `status` for efficient retrieval.
* MongoDB provides great performance for high write throughput, which suits webhook logging.

---

## üì¢ Backoff and Retry Strategy

The current backoff strategy uses a **static retry interval list** defined in [`src/app/constants.py`](src/app/constants.py):

```python
RETRY_INTERVALS = [10, 30, 60, 120, 300]  # in seconds
```

* Retries are limited to **5 attempts**.
* Static backoff is simple and predictable.
* This avoids wasting resources on excessive retries.
* For more flexibility, an **exponential backoff** mechanism can be implemented if needed with a formula like base * (2 ** attempt).

### ‚úÖ Signature Verification

If a `secret` is added to a subscription, both **outgoing webhooks** and **incoming ingest events** are verified using HMAC-SHA256:

* **Webhook delivery**: When the system sends an event to the `target_url`, it includes a header:

  ```
  X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=<HMAC_HEX>
  ```

  This is the HMAC-SHA256 of the JSON body, signed using the subscription‚Äôs `secret`. Receivers can use this to verify authenticity.

* **Webhook ingestion (`/ingest/{subscription_id}`)**: When an external service calls the `/ingest` endpoint to simulate an event, the system **verifies** the request by checking the signature using the stored secret. If the signature is invalid, the event is **rejected**.

  To successfully call `/ingest`, the request must include:

  ```
  X-Hub-Signature-256: sha256=<HMAC_HEX>
  ```

  where `<HMAC_HEX>` is the HMAC-SHA256 digest of the request body using the same `secret` configured for the subscription.

This ensures that **only trusted sources** can trigger webhook events for a given subscription.

## üéØ Event Type Filtering
Subscriptions can specify event_types like:

```json
["user.signup", "order.placed"]
```
Only matching events trigger webhook delivery.
If event_types is empty, the subscription will receive all events.

## üí∏ Cost Estimation

| Item                  | Free Tier Provider  | Estimated Usage         | Monthly Cost (Free Tier)    |

Assumptions:

* 5000 events/day, \~1.2 retries/event
* 1 container handles all workloads
* Minimal logging requirements
